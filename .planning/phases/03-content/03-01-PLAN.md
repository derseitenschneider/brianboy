<objective>
Populate the homepage with a compact hero section (name, intro, headshot, CTA) and a combined work section (Morntag, Eleno, Pressdify) in both German and English.

Purpose: Transform placeholder homepage into the real content — visitors immediately see who Brian is and what he does.
Output: Hero.astro, WorkSection.astro components; rewritten index pages; all Phase 3 translation strings in ui.ts.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add all Phase 3 translation strings and create placeholder headshot</name>
  <files>src/i18n/ui.ts, src/assets/images/headshot.jpg</files>
  <action>
    1. Create `src/assets/images/` directory.

    2. Create a placeholder headshot image at `src/assets/images/headshot.jpg`. Use a simple 400x400 solid-colored JPEG placeholder (generate via sharp, ImageMagick, or a simple script). This lets components import the image without build errors. The user will replace it with the real photo later.

    3. Extend `src/i18n/ui.ts` with ALL Phase 3 translation strings for BOTH languages. This includes keys for:
       - Hero section: `hero.intro` (2-3 sentence bio summary), `hero.cta` ("Get in touch" / "Kontakt aufnehmen")
       - Work section: `work.title`, and for each of Morntag/Eleno/Pressdify: `.name`, `.role`, `.description`, `.url`
         - Morntag: role = "Co-Owner" / "Mitinhaber", description = web development agency
         - Eleno: role = "Founder" / "Grunder", description = music education platform for teachers (dual: founded + product). URL: https://eleno.app
         - Pressdify: one-liner description as a WordPress-to-static-site tool. URL: https://pressdify.com
       - About page (for Plan 02): `about.title`, `about.meta` (meta description), `about.p1` through `about.p5` (narrative paragraphs: music school background, Halunke band, COVID pivot, self-taught coding + Morntag, Eleno SaaS journey)
         - Music gets enough detail to serve as the setup for the pivot story. Not one sentence.
         - The narrative arc: music school -> performing with Halunke -> COVID hits -> self-taught coding via tutorials -> co-founding Morntag agency -> building Eleno SaaS
       - Footer (for Plan 03): `footer.email.label` ("E-Mail" / "Email")
       - About page `about.p1`-`about.p5` should be actual narrative content (draft quality is fine, user will refine)

    Keep existing keys unchanged. Add new keys after existing ones in each language block. Ensure both `de` and `en` have identical key sets.

    NOTE: The existing keys `hero.greeting` and `hero.tagline` can remain but may no longer be used by the new Hero component. The new `hero.intro` replaces the tagline as the primary intro text.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx astro check` or `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript types are valid and both language blocks have matching keys. Verify the placeholder image exists at `src/assets/images/headshot.jpg`.</verify>
  <done>ui.ts contains all Phase 3 translation keys (hero, work, about, footer) in both de and en. Placeholder headshot exists in src/assets/images/.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Hero and WorkSection components, rewrite homepage</name>
  <files>src/components/Hero.astro, src/components/WorkSection.astro, src/pages/index.astro, src/pages/en/index.astro</files>
  <action>
    1. Create `src/components/Hero.astro`:
       - Accept no props (reads lang from Astro.url internally, like Footer does)
       - Import `{ Image } from 'astro:assets'` and headshot from `../assets/images/headshot.jpg`
       - Import `getLangFromUrl, useTranslations` from `../i18n/ui`
       - Layout: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16 md:py-24`
       - Use `flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-center gap-8 md:gap-12`
       - Left side (flex-1): h1 with "Brian Boy" (use `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold`), then `t("hero.intro")` paragraph (text-lg, text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400), then CTA button linking to `mailto:hello@brianboy.ch` with text `t("hero.cta")`. Style CTA as inline-flex with accent background color (use bg-accent-600 or the accent color from the theme), rounded-lg, text-white, hover state, transition-colors.
       - Right side (shrink-0): `<Image>` component with headshot, `alt="Brian Boy"`, width={300} height={300}, `class="rounded-full"`
       - Compact: NO min-h-screen or h-screen. Content below should peek in immediately.
       - Use `<section>` as root element.

    2. Create `src/components/WorkSection.astro`:
       - Same self-contained pattern (reads lang from Astro.url)
       - Layout: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16 md:py-24`
       - Section title: h2 with `t("work.title")`, styled `text-3xl font-bold mb-8`
       - Display 3 entries: Morntag, Eleno, Pressdify
       - Use a card-style layout (Claude's discretion per user decision). Suggestion: grid of cards with `grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`. Each card has border, rounded-lg, padding, hover:shadow-lg transition.
       - Each card shows: name (h3, font-semibold), role badge/label (text-sm, text-accent-600), description paragraph, and a link to the URL (external link with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer").
       - Eleno appears ONCE with dual role: "Founder" AND link to the product. Do NOT list Eleno twice.
       - Morntag role: "Co-Owner" / "Mitinhaber"
       - Pressdify: project entry with one-liner + link (no role label, or label it as "Project")
       - Add `scroll-reveal` class to the section for animation (from Phase 2).
       - All text via `t()` function, never hardcoded.

    3. Rewrite `src/pages/index.astro` (German homepage):
       - Import BaseLayout, Hero, WorkSection
       - Remove the current placeholder content
       - Render: `<Hero />` then `<WorkSection />` inside `<BaseLayout>`
       - Remove the `<main>` wrapper since BaseLayout already has `<main class="flex-1">` wrapping the slot
       - Keep title and description from t() functions

    4. Rewrite `src/pages/en/index.astro` (English homepage):
       - Same structure as German but with correct import paths (../../ layouts, ../../components, ../../i18n)
       - Uses same Hero and WorkSection components (they detect language internally)
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` to verify the site builds without errors. Run `npm run dev` and check that `/` shows the German hero + work section and `/en/` shows the English version. Verify the headshot image renders, CTA button has mailto link, and all 3 work entries appear.</verify>
  <done>Homepage displays compact hero with name, intro, headshot, and mailto CTA. Work section shows Morntag (Co-Owner), Eleno (Founder + link), and Pressdify (project + link) in card layout. Both languages render correctly.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` succeeds without errors
2. German homepage at `/` shows hero with name, intro paragraph, headshot photo, and "Kontakt aufnehmen" CTA
3. English homepage at `/en/` shows hero with name, intro paragraph, headshot photo, and "Get in touch" CTA
4. CTA button links to `mailto:hello@brianboy.ch`
5. Work section shows 3 entries: Morntag, Eleno, Pressdify with correct roles and descriptions
6. Eleno appears exactly once (not duplicated)
7. Hero is compact — scrolling down immediately reveals work section
8. Dark mode displays correctly for all new content
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Homepage is no longer placeholder content. Visitors see Brian's name, a short bio, his headshot, a way to contact him, and his work (Morntag, Eleno, Pressdify) — in both German and English.
