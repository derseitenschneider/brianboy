# Phase 3: Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Populate the homepage and about page with all content sections in both German and English. This includes: hero section, work/ventures/projects section, about page with bio narrative, and contact/social links integration into the footer. Content translation for both languages.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero section
- Name + short paragraph introduction (2-3 sentences summarizing who Brian is)
- Headshot photo displayed in the hero alongside the text
- Compact hero — not full viewport, content below peeks in immediately
- "Get in touch" CTA button that opens mailto directly (not scroll)

### Work section (ventures + projects combined)
- Single combined "Work" section (not separate ventures/projects sections)
- Eleno appears once as a single entry with dual role (founded + product link)
- Morntag labeled as "Co-Owner" with description as web development agency
- Pressdify as a project entry with one-liner + link
- Layout/card style: Claude's discretion

### About page
- Narrative starts with music origin, then COVID pivot to tech — music is the "before" that makes the "after" interesting
- Music gets enough detail to serve as context for the pivot (not just one sentence — it's the setup for the story)
- One continuous flowing narrative without section headings
- Headshot placement on about page: Claude's discretion

### Contact & social links
- Social links and email live in the footer (already built in Phase 2) — no separate contact section on pages
- Footer gets icon-only social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, X, Instagram)
- Email in footer as mailto link
- About page relies on footer for contact — no repeated contact section
- Hero CTA goes to mailto directly

### Claude's Discretion
- Work section layout style (cards vs list vs other)
- Headshot placement/sizing on about page
- Exact spacing and visual hierarchy within sections
- Translation tone for German vs English (formal vs casual)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Hero is compact — visitors should immediately see there's more below
- Music-first narrative on about page: music school, Halunke, then COVID pivot, self-taught coding, agency co-ownership, SaaS — the full arc
- Combined work section avoids Eleno appearing twice
- Footer already exists from Phase 2 — Phase 3 adds social icon links and email to it

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
