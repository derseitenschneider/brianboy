<objective>
Create the About page in both languages with a flowing narrative covering Brian's arc from music to tech.

Purpose: Give visitors the full story — music background, COVID pivot, self-taught coding journey, agency co-ownership, SaaS building. Makes the tech entrepreneur identity more compelling and human.
Output: about.astro and en/about.astro pages.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About pages in both languages</name>
  <files>src/pages/about.astro, src/pages/en/about.astro</files>
  <action>
    1. Create `src/pages/about.astro` (German about page):
       - Import BaseLayout from `../layouts/BaseLayout.astro`
       - Import `{ Image } from 'astro:assets'` and headshot from `../assets/images/headshot.jpg`
       - Import `getLangFromUrl, useTranslations` from `../i18n/ui`
       - Use `<BaseLayout title={...} description={t("about.meta")}>` with about.title in the title
       - Content wrapper: `<article class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16 md:py-24">`
       - Headshot: `<Image>` component with headshot, alt="Brian Boy", reasonable size (e.g., width={200} height={200}), rounded styling. Placement is Claude's discretion — could be at top, floated, or centered.
       - Narrative: Render `t("about.p1")` through `t("about.p5")` as sequential `<p>` tags with spacing (e.g., `space-y-6` on container or `mb-6` on each paragraph).
       - Style paragraphs with `text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300` for comfortable reading.
       - NO section headings within the narrative — one continuous flow per user decision.
       - NO contact section — the about page relies on the footer for contact per user decision.
       - Add `scroll-reveal` class to the article for subtle entrance animation.

    2. Create `src/pages/en/about.astro` (English about page):
       - Same structure as German version but with correct import paths (../../layouts, ../../assets, ../../i18n)
       - Uses same pattern — getLangFromUrl will return "en" for this path
       - Identical template structure (translations handle language differences)

    Both pages should render identically in structure, with language differences handled entirely by the translation system.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` to verify both pages compile. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/about` (German) and `/en/about` (English). Verify headshot displays, narrative flows as continuous paragraphs, no section headings appear within content, and navigation links from Phase 2 correctly reach the pages (no 404).</verify>
  <done>About page renders at /about and /en/about with headshot photo and flowing narrative (music origin -> COVID pivot -> tech career). No section headings. Both languages display correctly. Navigation links work.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` succeeds
2. `/about` shows German narrative with headshot
3. `/en/about` shows English narrative with headshot
4. Narrative flows continuously without section headings
5. Music origin story has enough detail (not just one sentence)
6. COVID pivot story is present
7. Navigation "About" links from Phase 2 reach the pages (no 404)
8. Dark mode renders correctly
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Visitors can read Brian's full story — from music school and Halunke to COVID pivot, self-taught coding, Morntag agency, and Eleno SaaS — in a flowing narrative on the About page, in both languages.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-content/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
