</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
Key patterns established that apply to Phase 3:
- i18n: Use getLangFromUrl, useTranslations, getLocalizedPath from src/i18n/ui.ts
- Dark mode: Use Tailwind dark: variant classes
- Responsive: Use Tailwind breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Layout: Content goes in BaseLayout slot (Header/Footer already integrated)
- Animations: Apply scroll-reveal class to sections for entrance animation
</decisions_made>

<context>
The site shell is complete. Phase 3 is about filling in the actual content — Brian's bio, projects, ventures, social links. The layout infrastructure (Header, Footer, Navigation, responsive breakpoints) is already in place, so Phase 3 should focus on content components and translations.

Phase 3 plans haven't been fully researched/planned yet. The placeholders in ROADMAP.md need to be turned into detailed plans via /gsd:plan-phase 3.
