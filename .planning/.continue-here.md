## Questioning (Complete)
Deep questioning session gathered all project context:
- Tech-first identity, music as differentiator
- Two ventures: Morntag (co-owner) + Eleno (founder) with equal billing
- Projects: Eleno + Pressdify (just links)
- Structure: Single page + About page (expanded version)
- Bilingual: German default, English toggle
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Sans-serif, tasteful animations, mobile-first
- SEO critical, no analytics
- Email-only contact
- Hosting: Hostpoint via FTP + GitHub Actions
- Domain: brianboy.ch (redirect derseitenschneider.ch)
- NO: blog, testimonials, CV, newsletter

## PROJECT.md (Complete & Committed)
Full project context captured at .planning/PROJECT.md

## config.json (Complete & Committed)
Settings: yolo mode, quick depth, parallel execution, commit docs
Workflow: research=on, plan_check=off, verifier=on
Model profile: quality (opus for researchers)

## Research (3/4 Complete)
- ✓ FEATURES.md written - table stakes vs differentiators categorized
- ✓ ARCHITECTURE.md written - component structure, theme/i18n patterns, build order
- ✓ PITFALLS.md written - 13 portfolio-specific pitfalls with prevention strategies
- ✗ STACK.md NOT written - agent was interrupted

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. **Complete Stack Research**
   - Spawn stack researcher agent to write STACK.md
   - Covers: Astro vs alternatives, CSS approach, animation libs, deployment

2. **Synthesize Research**
   - Spawn gsd-research-synthesizer to create SUMMARY.md
   - Consolidates all 4 research dimensions

3. **Define Requirements**
   - Present features by category from FEATURES.md
   - User scopes each category (v1/v2/out of scope)
   - Generate REQUIREMENTS.md with REQ-IDs

4. **Create Roadmap**
   - Spawn gsd-roadmapper with all context
   - Generate ROADMAP.md with phases
   - Initialize STATE.md
   - User approves or adjusts

5. **Project Initialized**
   - Present completion summary
   - Direct to /gsd:discuss-phase 1

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Identity**: Tech-first with music as humanizing differentiator
- **Structure**: Hybrid (single page + About page for expanded content)
- **Language**: German default, English toggle
- **Contact**: Email only (no form)
- **Projects**: Just name + one-liner + link (minimal)
- **Theme**: Dark/light toggle with system preference
- **Animations**: Tasteful touches (hover, scroll reveals) not excessive

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just interrupted mid-research

This is a personal portfolio rebuild for Brian - a tech entrepreneur (Morntag co-owner, Eleno founder)
who is also a professional musician (session guitarist for Halunke, teaches at music school). The site
replaces outdated derseitenschneider.ch which has old freelance projects from before he joined Morntag.

Design inspiration: steipete.me, jarredsumner.com, adamwathan.me, leerob.com - all clean, minimal dev sites.

The research so far is solid. FEATURES.md identified bilingual as highest complexity. ARCHITECTURE.md
recommends CSS custom properties for theme, client-side i18n with JSON files. PITFALLS.md emphasizes
SEO is critical (Person schema, hreflang for bilingual).

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:resume-work`

Specifically:
1. Spawn stack researcher agent to complete STACK.md
2. Then spawn synthesizer for SUMMARY.md
3. Continue with requirements definition
