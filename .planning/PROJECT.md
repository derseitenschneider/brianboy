# Brian Boy Portfolio

## What This Is

A personal portfolio website for Brian Boy — tech entrepreneur and musician. The site presents a tech-first identity (Morntag co-owner, Eleno founder) with music as a humanizing differentiator. It's an information site, not a blog: who I am, what I do, how to reach me.

## Core Value

When someone searches "Brian Boy" or gets sent a link, they immediately understand who he is and what he does — and feel confident reaching out.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Homepage with condensed bio and work overview
- [ ] About page with expanded version of homepage content
- [ ] Bilingual support (German default, English toggle)
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Project links: Eleno, Pressdify (name + one-liner + link each)
- [ ] Venture mentions: Morntag, Eleno (equal billing)
- [ ] Brief music mention as part of bio
- [ ] Origin story mention (COVID pivot from music to coding)
- [ ] Social links: GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram
- [ ] Email contact (mailto link, no form)

- [ ] Tasteful animations (hover effects, scroll reveals)
- [ ] Sans-serif typography
- [ ] Clean, timeless, modern aesthetic

### Out of Scope

- Blog/articles — not building a content platform
- Newsletter signup — not building an email list
- Contact form — email link is sufficient
- Testimonials — letting work speak for itself
- Detailed CV — not a resume site
- Analytics/tracking — privacy-first, no metrics
- Project screenshots/details — links out to actual products
- Detailed music section — brief mention only
- Morntag client work showcase — that belongs on Morntag site

## Context

**Current state:** derseitenschneider.ch exists but is outdated — projects listed are from early freelance days, visual design is dated, doesn't reflect current trajectory. Will redirect to new site.

**Domain:** brianboy.ch (derseitenschneider.ch redirects)

**Hosting:** Hostpoint (existing setup), deploy via GitHub Actions + FTP on push to main

**Tech background:** Started coding during COVID 2020, self-taught via tutorials, now co-owns dev agency and built own SaaS product. Four years from first tutorial to agency co-ownership is the arc.

**Design references:**
- steipete.me — minimal, scrolling sections
- jarredsumner.com — extremely minimal, basically just links
- adamwathan.me — single page with sections
- leerob.com — few pages but homepage is the star

**Audiences:**
1. Morntag potential clients — checking if he's legit before hiring agency
2. Eleno researchers — teachers/investors checking out founder
3. Networking — conference/podcast people wanting bio
4. Music world — Halunke fans, music school context

**Assets available:** One headshot, nothing else needed

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: Must deploy to Hostpoint via FTP (existing infrastructure)
- **No tracking**: Privacy-first, no analytics scripts
- **Bilingual**: Must support German and English with toggle
- **Mobile**: Must work excellently on mobile devices
- **Performance**: Fast loading for SEO (critical ranking requirement)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Tech-first identity | Current professional trajectory is tech, music is background | — Pending |
| Single page + About | Keeps content cohesive, About gives breathing room | — Pending |
| German default | Primary audience is Swiss, but English for Eleno/international | — Pending |
| No analytics | Privacy-first, success = being proud of it, not metrics | — Pending |
| Email only contact | Simple, no form maintenance, direct communication | — Pending |
| Projects as links | Let products speak for themselves, site stays minimal | — Pending |
